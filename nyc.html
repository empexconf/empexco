        Is Elixir Just Lisp? Demystifying Metaprogramming in Elixir and Beyond
      </h3>
        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            Metaprogramming is a powerful tool that many Elixir developers
            use every day. Via macros, we can write concise, reusable code,
            and even extend the language itself. But, metaprogramming in
            Elixir can be hard to grok, especially for newcomers. So in
            this talk, we’re going to review the inner workings of Elixir’s
            metaprogramming environment. We’ll start with a quick syntax
            review, and discuss in plain terms what the core components do for
            you. Then, we’ll talk about the essence of macros: modifying
            Elixir’s Abstract Syntax Tree to reshape your code at compile
            time. And finally, we’ll compare Elixir’s macros to metaprogramming
            approaches taken in other languages. Whether you’re new to
            Elixir or a seasoned developer, you should leave this talk with a
            clearer understanding of how this powerful set of Elixir
            abstractions works and how you can use it all confidently in your
            next project.

            Billy is a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY. He works at
            Frame.io, where he wrangles Elixir and JavaScript to help build

            2016 and started writing Elixir full-time in November 2018.
            When he's not writing code, he's probably baking or hanging out

          <p>
            In this talk we will present Mint, a new HTTP client for Elixir supporting HTTP/1 and HTTP/2. Mint has a process-less architecture using pure data structures, we will show why this architecture gives the developer more flexibility in how they can use the library but also the possible downsides of this approach. We will look at different use cases for Mint and finally go into some of the details of how to implement a HTTP library and how to build libraries using pure data structures.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
          Are you a parent of children, pets, or just really immature roommates? Do you wish you could use Elixir to help solve household issues and annoyances? Do you frequently over-engineer side projects? Then you might be a dadgineer (or momgineer).
          </p><p>
          This talk is compilation of fun projects using Elixir &amp; Nerves to solve silly problems around my home. Projects such as a ""Picture Board Turn Selector"" to programmatically answer the age old question of ""Whose turn is it!?"", complete with LED light show. Or hardening the security of the toy storage room with electromagnetic latching and biometric unlocking procedure.
          </p><p>
          The projects are overly complex for the problems they are solving, but my hope is that it helps inspire others to break into the world of hardware. To provide yet another set of wild examples to show how fun and sometimes surprisingly easy it is to create your own customizations in the physical world.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            Much of Elixir's hype has flowed around OTP: the concurrency and parallelism that promises multitasking at lightning speeds. However for newcomers to the language, the tools that enable this can be hard to visualize and intimidating to implement.
          </p><p>
            We'll start with processes and work up to GenServers. We'll take a look at a truly practical example of GenServers: an app that deploys hundreds of repos to Github Enterprise at once for students to use as lessons while maintaining global state. We'll delve into how it orchestrates the process with parallelism and fault tolerance. Both developers from OO backgrounds and those currently working in Elixir will gain a new comfort with the building blocks of multitasking and how to use them to their potential.

          <p>
            What happens after you cut a release? Getting your finished software in the hands of your users can be quite an ordeal, especially if you use tools that make things harder than they need to be. It turns out that a functional approach has benefits even after the development team has written their last line of code.
          </p><p>
            I will motivate and demonstrate using the Nix suite of tools to package and deploy a web service, showing how this helps us reconcile the sometimes conflicting priorities of development and operations teams and allows us to respond nimbly to change as it occurs.

        <h3 class="presentation__title">Demystifying Purely Functional Data Structures in Elixir</h3>
        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            Reasoning about data structures and run times in functional languages like Elixir is a far cry from classic analysis of data structures in imperative languages. While working with immutable data structures helps us reason about the flow of state in our programs, it has implications on the data structures we choose to work with and the efficiency of operations on those data structures. We will start by briefly laying some groundwork for analyzing functional data structures and discuss some optimizations used to prevent unnecessary copying while maintaining immutability. We'll move on to take a look at some basic data structures implemented with examples in Elixir and then discuss their characteristics. Starting from naive implementations of these basic data structures and related operations on them, we will consider how to further optimize operations to draw out more efficient run times. The talk will wrap up with a discussion of how to build an intuition for creating more efficient data structures in Elixir.

            Zack is a software engineer at Gaslight in Cincinnati, Ohio, and has spent the last couple of years working on a wide variety of projects -- ranging from server-side applications, to iOS and web frontend enterprise applications, to one-day hackathon projects, all the way to game development for personal enjoyment (and pain :-D). Ever since being introduced to Elixir, Erlang, and OTP in 2016, he has been a huge proponent of functional programming and an evangelist for a movement towards more immutability and no shared state wherever possible. Prior to entering the software industry, he was a professional translator specializing in English to Japanese translation. Outside of work, Zack is an avid traveler and a long distance runner (but only when it is not winter in Ohio because cold is NOT cool).

        Device to the Cloud with Nerves and NervesHub
      </h3>
      <div class="presentation__description">
        <p>
          The Elixir language and Erlang runtime provide a uniquely robust
          and productive environment that runs well from embedded to server.
          This class extends on previous Nerves training to the cloud for
          device/server communications and device management with NervesHub.
          Attendees will assemble real devices and build out the software
          step-by-step for a simple multi-user game with the help of the
          authors of Nerves.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll spend the first half of the day building the device and
          getting comfortable with developing and debugging on Nerves.
          If you’ve attended previous Nerves courses, this one will have
          greater emphasis on networking and device provisioning. The
          second half transitions to managing devices with NervesHub and
          developing a simple companion Phoenix application.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop is appropriate for beginners and expert Elixir
          programmers alike since it focuses more on embedded development
          than pure coding. Since the Nerves development is rapidly
          improving, even veteran embedded Elixir programmers will learn
          new ways of making their development cycle better. Beginners to
          Elixir are highly encouraged to create a couple toy projects and
          learn about GenServers and OTP releases beforehand.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will be providing Raspberry Pi’s and accessories to use
          during the class. It is unnecessary to buy hardware. We know
          from past classes that many people want to use hardware that
          they can take home. If you would like to do this, you can buy
          class materials beforehand:

        <p>
          Note that the Adafruit OLED Bonnet Pack requires you to solder a
          header onto the Raspberry Pi Zero. The Raspberry Pi Zero WH may be
          available with a pre-soldered header. Rest assured, if your
          hardware fails, we will provide a kit for the class.

        Thinking In Types
      </h3>
      <div class="presentation__description">
        <p>
        In this one-day workshop, we'll explore the distinguishing features
        of Haskell's type system. Haskell has several varieties of types:
        sum types, product types, newtypes, as well as functions over types
        (aka "HKTs" or "type constructors"). There is no "any" type, no
        "null" value, no "subtype" relationships.
        </p>

        <p>
        This workshop is intended for people who do not have much experience
        with the Haskell language, and the goal will be to give a practical
        understanding of some of Haskell's most important features and how
        to start thinking in types. Please come prepared to write code. It
        is recommended that you have GHC installed before the workshop begins.

          <h3 class="presentation__title">Crash Course in Elixir, for (Ruby, Java, JS, etc) Developers</h3>
          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>Are you interested in Elixir, but you haven't yet learned the language?</p>
            <p>Are you an imperative language programmer who's finding it tricky to get a handle on the functional approach?</p>
            <p>Do you find yourself wishing that Elixir had a "for loop"?</p>
            <p>We've all been there, and we've developed a one-day workshop to get you past the learning curve.  Starting with the absolute fundamentals of Elixir's datatypes, we'll take you through every aspect of the language that tripped us up when we were learning.</p>
            <p>By the end of the day, you will be able to confidently solve complex business problems faster and more reliably than you'd have ever believed possible.  Learning to build solutions on top of immutable data structures requires a new way of thinking, and we've designed our workshop to get you thinking that way quickly.</p>
            <p>
              We will cover:
              <ul>
                <li>All the built-in datatypes: numbers, binaries (strings), lists, maps, structures, tuples, and atoms.</li>
                <li>Functions: anonymous functions, named functions, and higher order functions.</li>
                <li>Pattern matching:  This is a hugely powerful technique, and is probably the one thing most developers miss when they find themselves coding in another language after experiencing it in Elixir.</li>
                <li>Elixir tooling: How our projects are organized, the build system, the dependency management system, the test framework, and the rich documentation system.</li>
                <li>How to model problems using functional patterns instead of Object Oriented patterns.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Our aim is to provide a mentally challenging, but enormously rewarding day.  Every segment will include hands-on exercises and challenges, and we will have two instructors helping you if you get stuck.</p>
            <p>Who should come?  The course is not for complete beginners. You should be comfortable programming in some language, but what language is unimportant.  People whose proficiency lies outside the functional paradigm will probably get the most out of the course, but functional programmers who are new to Elixir will find the course to be a useful survey of the main features of the  Elixir ecosystem.</p>
