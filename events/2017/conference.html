        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            One of the key tenets of functional programming is that functions are first-class citizens. Amongst other things, this means that functions can be accepted as parameters to other functions. While this seems like an interesting idea in theory, developers new to functional programming often have a hard time understanding how to apply higher order functions in their day-to-day work. This talk will give an overview of what higher order functions are, and how we may already be using them in our daily programming life using Elixir library functions like map, filter and reduce. With this background, we will show how to create and use our own higher order functions to increase readability, decrease repetition and simplify the testing process.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
          Python has become the dominant language for machine learning, and as an Elixir dev, that’s a real bummer. When building machine learning systems, there’s lots of reasons to want to use tools like metaprogramming, concurrency, supervision, distribution, higher-order functions, and all of the other things that Elixir does well. This talk introduces a library that tries to let Elixir and Python each do what they do best, in collaboration.
          </p>
          <p>
          Galápagos Nǎo is an Elixir library to evolve deep neural networks. Under the hood it uses the Gluon Python API to Apache MXNet, to take advantage of one of the most flexible and performant deep learning libraries around. The goal of this unholy union of technologies is to do something even harder than building deep learning models: build an ecosystem that evolves deep learning model architectures. Just for fun, the framework also includes shiny features like interactive evolution and optimization of architectures for non-functional requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
          Other exciting highlights:

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            What is pattern matching in Elixir? For this developer, it's what won me over to the language. This deceptively powerful paradigm is at the heart of what makes Elixir such a compelling language to program in. It's doing so much more than help you write small, declarative, maintainable functions; it's making you a stronger programmer. This talk covers pattern matching basics, then moves into practical, real world examples for a thorough introduction to Elixir's implementation of this crush-worthy construct.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            As part of my day job I write and maintain SchedEx, a Swiss Army knife for job scheduling in Elixir. It's an indispensable library that sits at the core of a product used in manufacturing plants worldwide. An after work discussion led me down the path of applying SchedEx to soft real-time scheduling, and before long the beats project was born. Using the production proven SchedEx library as a foundation, beats is an ncurses-based, file-driven, actually-sort-of-useful drum machine that also happens to be a great lab for exploring scheduling. The talk will provide a tour of several real world patterns for job scheduling within Elixir, demonstrate some strengths and limitations of the Erlang runtime, and also build up a few classic beats &amp; breaks along the way.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            SMS is the dominant communication channel for how business is done in Africa. The healthcare industry, in particular, has taken advantage of targeted messaging to better patient outcomes. Our team had the opportunity to architect a messaging platform that integrates into any number of partner hospitals to leverage SMS. By filtering patients based on their condition, demographics, or location, healthcare workers can effectively communicate with their patient base. To achieve this, medical records need to be up-to-date. How do we effectively manage updates in a way that is fault-tolerant? How can we ensure that we don't overwhelm a partner's API? What solution gives us the tools to support multiple partners in the same system? In this talk, we'll share how we used GenStage to answer all of these questions and share our road to production.

            You've used Phoenix Channels to build real-time features like collaborative text editors, games and chatting apps. But how can you acheive the common real-time aim of tracking and displaying a user's participation in such features? While we can leverage GenServers to build out features like displaying the users in a chat room and indicating who is typing, that approach leaves us responsible for hand rolling *a lot* of code. Enter Phoenix Presence! The Phoenix Presence module provides an API for you to register information regarding a given topic and expose that information to all of that topic's channels. Phoenix Presence is powerful because it is distributed and resilient––unlike tools like Redis, which rely on a centralized data store, Presence uses a conflict-free replicated data type protocol. 
          <p></p> 
            You'll learn how to use Phoenix Presence to track user participation in a real-time feature and you'll gain a deeper understanding of the technology behind the awesome power of Phoenix Presence. We'll look at how to include Phoenix Presence in a Phoenix app that already leverages channels to implement a real-time collaborative text editor. If you have some experience with Phoenix Channels, all the better, but we'll cover some high-level Phoenix Channel concepts and spend most of our time on the incorporation of Phoenix Presence on the back-end, with a brief look at some Phoenix Presence client-side code.

        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
            This talk is retelling my journey down the rabbit hole of dealing with date &amp; time.
          </p>
          <p>
          We will start the journey with date/time recurrences. Then, we will look at time intervals and operations around them. Finally, we will look at Eric Evans' talk "Exploring Time" which gives a fresh look at date/time in general and intervals in particular (spoiler alert: there might be some relevant research from the 80s around that too!). We will model both recurrences and intervals as streams and we will try to show that Elixir's extensibility makes it a great language for developing business applications.

        <h3 class="presentation__title">Parallel Computation with Elixir</h3>
        <div class="presentation__description">
          <p>
          Elixir provides a few tools to parallelize computation and parallel processing of collections in particular. These tools operate at different levels of abstraction and complexity. On one end, you can manually spawn processes to do work and manually collect results; on the other end, you can use more complex tools like GenStage and Flow. The choice of tool depends on the situation at hand.
          </p><p>
          In this training, we want to explore the tools available for parallel computation, alongside their use cases and their strength and weaknesses. We will start from the simplest approach of manually spawning processes, move on to tasks and Task.async_stream, and finally work with GenStage and Flow.
          </p><p>
          This tutorial is aimed for people that are familiar with Elixir syntax and with the &quot;functional&quot; and data-related part of Elixir (data types, modules, functions). Knowledge about processes is welcome, but we are prepared to introduce concurrency in Elixir in case the audience is not strong on the area.

          <h3 class="presentation__title">Crash Course in Elixir, for (Ruby, Java, JS, etc) Developers</h3>
          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>Are you interested in Elixir, but you haven't yet learned the language?</p>
            <p>Are you an imperative language programmer who's finding it tricky to get a handle on the functional approach?</p>
            <p>Do you find yourself wishing that Elixir had a "for loop"?</p>
            <p>We've all been there, and we've developed a one-day workshop to get you past the learning curve.  Starting with the absolute fundamentals of Elixir's datatypes, we'll take you through every aspect of the language that tripped us up when we were learning.</p>
            <p>By the end of the day, you will be able to confidently solve complex business problems faster and more reliably than you'd have ever believed possible.  Learning to build solutions on top of immutable data structures requires a new way of thinking, and we've designed our workshop to get you thinking that way quickly.</p>
            <p>
              We will cover:
              <ul>
                <li>All the built-in datatypes: numbers, binaries (strings), lists, maps, structures, tuples, and atoms.</li>
                <li>Functions: anonymous functions, named functions, and higher order functions.</li>
                <li>Pattern matching:  This is a hugely powerful technique, and is probably the one thing most developers miss when they find themselves coding in another language after experiencing it in Elixir.</li>
                <li>Elixir tooling: How our projects are organized, the build system, the dependency management system, the test framework, and the rich documentation system.</li>
                <li>How to model problems using functional patterns instead of Object Oriented patterns.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>Our aim is to provide a mentally challenging, but enormously rewarding day.  Every segment will include hands-on exercises and challenges, and we will have two instructors helping you if you get stuck.</p>
            <p>Who should come?  The course is not for complete beginners. You should be comfortable programming in some language, but what language is unimportant.  People whose proficiency lies outside the functional paradigm will probably get the most out of the course, but functional programmers who are new to Elixir will find the course to be a useful survey of the main features of the  Elixir ecosystem.</p>
