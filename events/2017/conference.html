      Monitoring Production Elixir Applications
    </h3>
    
    <div class="presentation__description">
      <p>You just celebrated the launch of your first production elixir application and now have real users using your application. In this talk, you&#39;ll learn how to measure and monitor your elixir application as your user base grows from hundreds of daily users to millions. With more users comes more revenue, but also more technical challenges as you go from one server to many. And &#39;tail –f&#39; is no longer useful when the logs are going by faster than you can read or the requests are load balanced across many servers. In this talk you&#39;ll learn the best practices for monitoring your applications in a way that will scale as you grow. Best of all these practices are universal, so they will be applicable if your organization is solely in the BEAM world or if you&#39;re are in a polyglot environment. Lastly, you&#39;ll learn about to measure availability in the context of web applications and how many nines of availability your API has.</p>

      Solid Ground
    </h3>
    
    <div class="presentation__description">
      <p>The BEAM, the official Erlang VM implementation, is the most important piece of the puzzle in the Elixir ecosystem. It provides some strong guarantees which minimize or completely remove some classes of problems and simplify implementation of fault-tolerant systems. It is the foundation which makes all other things in the ecosystem possible. The OTP framework, as well as third party libraries and frameworks, such as Phoenix, Ecto, or Nerves, make most sense when running on top of BEAM. Replace BEAM with something else, and you&#39;ll lose some important guarantees, which in turn can make your life much more complicated. In this talk we’ll take a closer look at a couple of seemingly simple, yet very powerful properties of BEAM, focusing in particular on some aspects of its lightweight concurrency. Going further, we’ll explore how OTP builds on top of these guarantees to bring us reliable higher-level abstractions such as supervisors. For good measure, there will be a couple of demos to make these claims more concrete.</p>

      Channels as Controllers (An Exercise in Refactoring)
    </h3>
    
    <div class="presentation__description">
      <p>Phoenix Channels are one of the framework&#39;s best features, making real-time applications a snap. But what happens when a channel&#39;s responsibilities grow to the point of ill-repute? We&#39;ll look at the evolution of a single Phoenix Channel implementation over the course of several small and related features, and we&#39;ll see what patterns Elixir developers can leverage to keep their Channels skinny.</p>

      Understanding Elixir's (re)compilation
    </h3>
    
    <div class="presentation__description">
      <p>Elixir&#39;s code-generation capabilities require a sophisticated compiler with complex dependency tracking. Given such complexity, it is often unclear why sometimes changing a single line in a single file triggers the recompilation of a hundred others. In this talk we are going to take a deep dive into what happens when you type &quot;mix compile&quot; with the aim of clarifying what is happening.</p>

      <p>The halting problem is a classical concept in computer science. In &quot;Scooping the Loop Snooper,&quot; Geoffrey K.

      Functional Data Structures
    </h3>
    
    <div class="presentation__description">
      <p>Most developers learn data structures in the context of imperative or object oriented languages. Chris Okasaki, in &quot;Purely Functional Data Structures,&quot; proved that they can be written from a functional perspective, but his examples are steeped in ML/Haskell semantics. We will take the functional data structures of Okasaki and others, explain them in Elixir terms, and show their practical uses and performance implications. We will aim to be as &#39;real world&#39; as possible while showing Elixir&#39;s capability to go beyond the standard library data structures. And we&#39;ll see how its semantics favorably support functional data structures.</p>

	<h2 class="course__name">Intermediate Elixir</h2>
  <div class="course__summary">
    <p>This course will be taught by <strong>James Fish</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/fishcakez">fishcakez</a>), well-known Elixir expert and Elixir Core Team member. James will be assisted by Elixir veterans <strong>Chris Bell</strong> and <strong>David Antaramian</strong>.</p>

<p>The intermediate/advanced Elixir training will help those familiar with the Elixir language pickup the skills of how to work with and model applications using Processes and the OTP library.</p>

<p>In this course we will take a complex real-world problem and use a variety of tools and techniques to solve it. Along the way we&#39;ll cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>Structuring applications using an umbrella app</li>
<li>Keeping state in GenServers / Agents / ETS tables</li>
<li>Thinking in Processes to solve the problem at hand</li>
<li>Using Supervision trees to create resilient programs that can recover from failure</li>
<li>Testing our work as we go using isolated unit tests and integration tests</li>
</ul>

<p>You&#39;ll come away from this course with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts to your next Elixir project as well as a repository and source material that you can reference in the future.</p>

	<h2 class="course__name">Crash Course in Elixir, for (Ruby, Java, JS, etc) Developers</h2>
  <div class="course__summary">
    <p>Are you interested in Elixir, but you haven&#39;t yet learned the language?</p>

<p>Are you an imperative language programmer who&#39;s finding it tricky to get a handle on the functional approach?</p>

<p>Do you find yourself wishing that Elixir had a &quot;for loop&quot;?</p>

<p>We&#39;ve all been there, and we&#39;ve developed a one-day workshop to get you past the learning curve.  Starting with the absolute fundamentals of Elixir&#39;s datatypes, we&#39;ll take you through every aspect of the language that tripped us up when we were learning.</p>

<p>By the end of the day, you will be able to confidently solve complex business problems faster and more reliably than you&#39;d have ever believed possible.  Learning to build solutions on top of immutable data structures requires a new way of thinking, and we&#39;ve designed our workshop to get you thinking that way quickly.</p>

<p>Finally, we will introduce the Elixir concurrency model.  If your experience of concurrency consists of threads, mutexes, and critical sections, you will be amazed at the simplicity of building reliable concurrent systems using Elixir and OTP.</p>

<p>We will cover:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the built-in datatypes: numbers, binaries (strings), lists, maps, structures, tuples, and atoms.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions: anonymous functions, named functions, and higher order functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Pattern matching:  This is a hugely powerful technique, and is probably the one thing most developers miss when they find themselves coding in another language after experiencing it in Elixir.</p></li>
<li><p>Elixir tooling: How our projects are organized, the build system, the dependency management system, the test framework, and the rich documentation system.</p></li>
<li><p>How to model problems using functional patterns instead of Object Oriented patterns.</p></li>
<li><p>OTP: OTP is a powerful framework developed for Erlang, and battle-hardened after 30 years of continuous ongoing development.  A complete view of OTP is beyond the scope of this course, but we will introduce the high level concepts.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Our aim is to provide a mentally challenging, but enormously rewarding day.  Every segment will include hands-on exercises and challenges, and we will have two instructors helping you if you get stuck.</p>

<p>Who should come?  The course is not for complete beginners. You should be comfortable programming in some language, but what language is unimportant.  People whose proficiency lies outside the functional paradigm will probably get the most out of the course, but functional programmers who are new to Elixir will find the course to be a useful survey of the main features of the  Elixir ecosystem.</p>
