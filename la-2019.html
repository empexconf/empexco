            Opening Keynote - War Stories: Scaling Distributed Systems
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
            Architecting a highly concurrent distributed system in the BEAM ecosystem is not an easy thing to do even on a perfect world of homogeneous traffic, reliable, secure and low latency networks. But real life internet applications may have millions of users and bizarre faulty scenarios that can arise hidden scaling issues.
            </p>

            <p>
            In this talk, I'll describe how the distribution model works in Erlang, and when/how you should take advantage of it –or not! Spiced up with real-life war stories from architectures running in production. Hopefully, you can learn from our mistakes!

            <strong>About Miriam:</strong>
            Miriam loves to architect distributed, scalable, high performance, high concurrency, and high availability systems. Bonus point if they are written in Erlang/Elixir. She is a Staff Engineer at AdRoll, designing critical parts of their AdServers/RTB infrastructure and organizer of the Erlang and Elixir meetup in San Francisco. Prior to AdRoll, she provided Erlang specialized consultancy and studied Computer Science Engineering from La Coruña University in Spain. Voted one of the women to watch in 2018 by Women 2.0 here. She published some open source libraries such as mero, a scalable and lightweight client for Memcached and Spillway for load shedding.

            Lessons From Our First Trillion Messages with Flow
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              For many of us recent Elixir converts, our initial attraction to Elixir was rooted in the promise of access to the BEAM concurrency model.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this has been possible in Elixir from day one, Flow has made it incredibly easy to build highly concurrent and parallel data pipelines utilizing the BEAM. The problem is that while the docs are great, there aren't many resources about running Flow-based systems in production.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this talk I'll share some of the lessons my team has learned from processing our first trillion messages through Flow. You'll leave with practical knowledge you can directly apply to your applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the last year, my team &amp; I have been using Flow to power a reactive, high volume and mission-critical data processing pipeline. In that time we've recognized some patterns and techniques to keep our system easy to reason about while also being flexible to handle a variety of requirements.

            Go vs Elixir: A concurrency comparison
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>

            <p>
              In this talk we will compare Go and Elixir. These languages have similar principles but make core tradeoffs that affect when one might use them. We will specifically  compare their concurrency paradigms to see what tool we might use when.

              A look at how Amnesia's Elixir wrapper over Erlang's Mnesia distributed DBMS can be used to keep your application state in a scalable resilient manner. We will start by looking at Agents and GenServers as they are primarily the first thing people reach for when storing state. From there we will show how we can gain performance, remove bottlenecks, and increase stability by using ETS. Finally we examine how a more robust Amnesia solution can help systems scale beyond a single node, allowing the system to not only support higher loads but increase resiliency.

            Elixir Code is Elixir! Metaprogramming and Elixir
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              Elixir is a programming language that has become dear to me as it has become my go-to choice for most of the things at work and personal projects. One thing that people notice when getting started with Elixir is that, in fact, a good chunk of it is written in Elixir. Now you might be thinking, "Wait. What? How can that be?". Well, the short answer is: metaprogramming.
            </p>
            <p>
              Metaprogramming doesn’t have to be too scary to think about and it’s not so bad at all. I’ll show examples of the standard library where functionality is written in Elixir and I will also dive into extending Elixir by writing our own macros. But by also diving into the Elixir-lang code base we can explore the bootstrap process and see how you can start implementing Elixir in Elixir.

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              In 2016, a magazine publisher asked Position Development to completely revamp their existing Haskell app. Early into the project, the original creator of the app left Position to begin a career in research. I was suddenly the most experienced Haskell developer on my team, while I still had less than a year of professional experience in tech. In this talk, I’ll discuss both a) the technical aspects of the work and b) what it was like to try to make it all happen as part of a very small team of non-expert Haskellers. Some of the topics I’ll touch on include:
              <ul>
              <li>Larceny, our HTML templating language</li>
              <li>Offset, our library for rendering content from JSON APIs</li>
              <li>Position's workflow for developing, testing, and deploying Haskell apps</li>
              <li>Feeling disconnected from the larger language community, struggling with imposter syndrome, and continuing to learn and grow as a functional programmer</li>

            Handling Null in Functional Programming
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              Nulls are a fact of life—sometimes a value can be absent, which is important information to have However if a variable can be null, we often have to write extra code to handle that possibility. How can we utilize functional, typed languages to only allow null where it communicates important information and eliminate it everywhere else? This talk will identify patterns to do just that and discuss how they can help shape your application’s architecture.

            Rebuilding a BDD Testing Framework (ESpec):<br/>
            Foundations in Metaprogramming
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              You're a Test-Driven Development disciple, but you're a little iffy on this whole metaprogramming thing and it's something you don't feel comfortable using in your day to day programming.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you've looked through the ExUnit codebase, or its RSpec-inspired cousin, ESpec (RSpec is a Ruby on Rails testing framework), you've probably noticed the defmacro keyword. That's because these test frameworks make use of metaprogramming to give you those lovely DSL's.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't know what the defmacro keyword does? Don't worry.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even if you've never used Elixir's metaprogramming features before, come learn how to do it by seeing a real-life application of them. During this talk, we will rebuild a small part of our own version of ESpec. We'll duck and weave through Elixir's basic metaprogramming features all while building out test assertions and error messages, and you'll gain a whole new appreciation for metaprogramming.

            <p>
              Having an Elixir application deployed it's crucial to have good insight into your architecture for multiple reasons. High level of observability helps you scale, improve your system's performance, optimise, debug and decide how to develop your product further.Good understanding of what your system is doing is even more important when it grows in time and uses more and more third party components that you don't have much influence over.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my presentation I'm going to share my experience with integrating a significantly large Elixir system, with a state of the art monitoring service - Datadog. I'm going to explain how various features it offers, like metrics, live tracing, logging and analysis tools helped find number of non-obvious bottlenecks in the code.

            Device to the Cloud with Nerves and NervesHub
          </h3>

          <div class="presentation__description">
            <p>
              The Elixir language and Erlang runtime provide a uniquely robust and productive environment that runs well from embedded to server. This class extends on previous Nerves training to the cloud for device/server communications and device management with NervesHub. Attendees will assemble real devices and build out the software step-by-step for a simple multi-user game with the help of the authors of Nerves.
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ll spend the first half of the day building the device and getting comfortable with developing and debugging on Nerves. If you’ve attended previous Nerves courses, this one will have greater emphasis on networking and device provisioning. The second half transitions to managing devices with NervesHub and developing a simple companion Phoenix application.
            </p>
            <p>
              The workshop is appropriate for beginners and expert Elixir programmers alike since it focuses more on embedded development than pure coding. Since the Nerves development is rapidly improving, even veteran embedded Elixir programmers will learn new ways of making their development cycle better. Beginners to Elixir are highly encouraged to create a couple toy projects and learn about GenServers and OTP releases beforehand.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will be providing Raspberry Pi’s and accessories to use during the class. It is unnecessary to buy hardware. We know from past classes that many people want to use hardware that they can take home. If you would like to do this, you can buy class materials beforehand:

              Are you interested in building your next production application in Elixir, but don't feel confident that you'll be able to handle the ins and outs of creating and maintaining a live system?  After this course, you will. We'll walk through application design patterns, testing strategies, monitoring solutions, and bugfixing strategies so you can feel comfortable taking the leap into the next generation of reliable, scalable applications. There will also be a discussion and Q&A with engineers who have spent years working on production Elixir apps.
