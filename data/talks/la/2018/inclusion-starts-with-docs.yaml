  Great documentation is the single most powerful tool for increasing inclusion in a project. Docs can level the playing field between beginners and experts, providing everyone a better understanding of using and contributing to a library.

  The feeling of creating a project, putting it out there, and watching people contribute to it is breathtaking -- it's one of the things that gets people hooked on participating in the free software ecosystem. High-quality docs get a project, and its creator, to that point faster.

  Lucky for us, Elixir has best-in-class features for authoring and generating online documentation. In this talk, we'll examine and demonstrate Elixir's doc system, covering in particular:

  An introduction to ExDoc
  Top level project docs using @moduledoc
  Function docs using @doc
  Executable code samples using doctests
  Type annotations and docs using typespecs
  Linking your docs to your source code
  Magically auto-updating install instructions
  Documentation techniques and tactics for other kinds of projects (e.g. HTTP APIs)
  This talk has two goals: to show the power of Elixir's built-in docs system, and more importantly to get folks excited about how strongly fantastic docs can improve a project and its community.
