title: A Swarm of Processes - Simulating Ant Foraging Behavior with OTP of Processes
conference: "LA 2018"
youtube_id: NKJFL9LpP4M
description: |
  In this talk, we'll see a simulation of a foraging ant colony that can efficiently solve mazes, built using a separate OTP process for each ant. Along the way we'll look at GenServers, dynamic Supervisors, Registries, and more OTP goodness. We’ll also learn a little bit about ants!
