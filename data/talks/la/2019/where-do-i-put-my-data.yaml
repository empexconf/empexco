  A look at how Amnesia's Elixir wrapper over Erlang's Mnesia distributed DBMS can be used to keep your application state in a scalable resilient manner. We will start by looking at Agents and GenServers as they are primarily the first thing people reach for when storing state. From there we will show how we can gain performance, remove bottlenecks, and increase stability by using ETS. Finally we examine how a more robust Amnesia solution can help systems scale beyond a single node, allowing the system to not only support higher loads but increase resiliency.
