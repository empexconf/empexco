    bio: |
      Ashi is a visual poet who has been telling stories with code and words since she was a childâ€”perhaps before. She has worked at seven-person startups, fought fires in the trenches of SRE at Google, and spent the last three years teaching at coding bootcamps. She now works as a senior software engineer at GitHub, where she hopes to dissolve the walls between us and our tools. She is learning to regard every moment, and the creatures within them, with love.
