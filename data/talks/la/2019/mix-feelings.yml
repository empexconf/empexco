  Yes, Elixirâ€™s great, itâ€™s based on Erlang, making it fault tolerant and scalable. But a few months with it day-to day, am I still singing its praises?

    bio: |
      Originally hailing from the Midwest, Aaron made the trek out to Los Angeles in 2010 to work for one of those exciting internet startups heâ€™d been hearing so much about. Since then, heâ€™s led teams at LA-based startups Fullscreen and Ring, both of which are all grown up now. He currently works at Carbon Five, where heâ€™s been working with such languages as Ruby (his long time favorite) and more recently Elixir (current frontrunner to become new long time favorite). His clicky keyboard collection grows at a rate of about 1 per 1.4 months, but he can stop whenever he wants.
