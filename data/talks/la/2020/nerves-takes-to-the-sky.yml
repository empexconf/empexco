  The problem with a paper airplane, is that it always seems to turn one way or the other. I can never get them to maintain a steady course. What if Nerves was riding along as the pilot?

  We'll first talk about inertial measurement sensors and how they can report their position in 3-D space. Then we'll dive into how we can talk to those sensors from a Nerves project. We'll end by talking about some logistics around weight, battery, etc and with any luck a live demo of tossing a glider over the heads of the audience. I'll bring a video as backup in-case the live demo is hazardous or fails.
