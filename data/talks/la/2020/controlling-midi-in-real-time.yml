title: Controlling MIDI Devices in Real Time with Elixir and Nerves
conference: EMPEX LA 2020

description: |
  MIDI is a specification developed in the 80s to allow musical instruments to talk to each other in near real-time. This inter-instrument talk involved sending notes, changing syntesizer patches, and modifying a song's BPM. Since the 80s, MIDI has continued to be the go-to specification for controlling musical instruments, lighting rigs, and more!

  In this talk, I'll demonstrate how Elixir can control MIDI devices (specifically, for this talk, an analog synthesizer) in real-time. I'll show how OTP provides a great way to implement this control and the benefits and drawbacks of using it for real-time musical instrumentation.

  Furthermore, I will demonstrate how this system is then visualized using Phoenix and LiveView.
