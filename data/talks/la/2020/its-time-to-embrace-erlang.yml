  As a community we have gone to incredible lengths to avoid ever writing or even looking at Erlang syntax. This has lead to a fractured community, unnecessary dependencies, and opaque code. Even worse, it has prevented us from improving the language that started our ecosystem. This talk points out some common mistakes we make, and ways to improve our code and our ecosystem.
