description: |
  Writing efficient data structures in Erlang isn't something that's normally done - but by borrowing from both Purely Functional Data Structures, some additional work on Finger Trees, and occasionally cheating with some C code, we can get performance that beats the native OTP implementations. I've written many different versions of data structures for my previous jobs and now I am in the process of bundling up the modules, polishing them up, and open sourcing them for the public's enjoyment and use. Specifically, I'll be covering implementations of mergeable / non-mergeable heaps, queues, and indexable arrays.
