title: Stream-processing connected vehicle data in Elixir
conference: EMPEX LA 2020

description: |
  “Smart” and connected vehicles generate TONS of data. To make use of that data from a fleet of vehicles for analysis of V2V interactions, traffic patterns, or control flow, you have to consume as much of it as fast as possible with high fidelity. The team at SmartColumbus has spent the last year building robust data ingestion capabilities in Elixir at the speed and scale needed to support thousands of vehicles simultaneously.

  This talk will showcase the strategies developed for concurrent processing, batching, and validating data across each of these unique streams. You’ll learn about the design decisions the team has made as well as the open source libraries we’ve developed to enable data consumption at the scale of a “Smart City”.
