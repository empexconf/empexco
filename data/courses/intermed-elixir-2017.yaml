title: Intermediate Elixir
description: |
    The intermediate / advanced Elixir training will help those familiar with the Elixir language pickup the skills of how to work with and model applications using Processes and the OTP library.
    
    In this course we will be take a complex real-world problem and use a variety of tools and techniques to solve it. Along the way we'll cover:
        
    - Structuring applications using an Umbrella App
    - Keeping state in GenServers / Agents / ETS tables
    - Thinking in Processes to solve the problem at hand
    - Using Supervision trees to create resilient programs that can recover from failure
    - Testing our work as we go using isolated unit tests and integration tests
                            
    You'll come away from this course with a clear understanding of how to apply these concepts to your next Elixir project as well as a repository and source material that you can reference in the future.
                              
    The course will be taught by two Elixir veterans; Chris Bell and David Antaramian.
