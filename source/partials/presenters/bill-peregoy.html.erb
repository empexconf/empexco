          <p>
            One of the key tenets of functional programming is that functions are first-class citizens. Amongst other things, this means that functions can be accepted as parameters to other functions. While this seems like an interesting idea in theory, developers new to functional programming often have a hard time understanding how to apply higher order functions in their day-to-day work. This talk will give an overview of what higher order functions are, and how we may already be using them in our daily programming life using Elixir library functions like map, filter and reduce. With this background, we will show how to create and use our own higher order functions to increase readability, decrease repetition and simplify the testing process.
